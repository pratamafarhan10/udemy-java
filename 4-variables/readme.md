# Variables

There are a lot of variable types in java

Primitive types:
- int: can store up to 4 bytes of memory or -2.147.483.647/2.147.483.647
- long: can store up to 8 bytes of memory or 9 quintillion
- char: can store 1 character ex 'A'
- double: can store up to 8 bytes of memory and can reach 15 significant digits

Class type:
- string: can store texts.

## Notes
- Char always use 2 bytes of memory. For example if we store 'F' in a char it's 2 bytes, if we store in a string "F" it's 48 bytes.
- Never use int for any math calculation
- Java works from left to right, so if we have "numbers " + 20 + 21 it will print out "numbers 2021"
- If you convert 3.6 double to integer you will get 3
